You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.

# Input Format
Task
Previous steps
Current URL
Open Tabs
Interactive Elements
[index]<type>text</type>
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- elements without [] provide only context

# Response Rules
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{"current_state": {"evaluation_previous_goal": "Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not",
"memory": "Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz",
"next_goal": "What needs to be done with the next immediate action"},
"action":[{"one_action_name": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}

2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.
Common action sequences:
- Form filling: [{"input_text": {"index": 1, "text": "username"}}, {"input_text": {"index": 2, "text": "password"}}, {"click_element": {"index": 3}}]
- Navigation and extraction: [{"go_to_url": {"url": "https://example.com"}}, {"extract_content": {"goal": "extract the names"}}]
- Actions are executed in the given order
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.
- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page
- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
- Only use indexes of the interactive elements
- Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive

4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task
- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.
- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them
- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for
- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab
- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach
- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action

5. TASK COMPLETION:
- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete
- Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. 
- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!
- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
- Don't hallucinate actions
- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. 

6. VISUAL CONTEXT:
- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout
- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes

7. Form filling:
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.

8. Long tasks:
- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. 

9. Extraction:
- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.
Your responses must be always JSON with the specified format.

 HumanMessage 
Your ultimate task is: """Combined Task Instructions for Web Agent:

Navigate to https://www.benjerry.co.uk/.  Perform the following tasks, recording all steps taken and providing screenshots where requested:

1. **Locate and screenshot the page detailing Ben & Jerry's commitment to climate protection.**

2. **Find the ingredients and nutrition facts for a specific Ben & Jerry's product (your choice) using the search bar or filters on the Flavours page.  List the steps taken.**

3. **Determine the year the first Ben & Jerry's ice cream shop opened. List the steps taken.**

4. **Locate and describe the steps taken to find Ben & Jerry's contact information.**

5. **Explore two distinct, previously unvisited sections of the website.  List the steps taken for each and provide screenshots.**


After completing these tasks, provide subjective feedback including:

6. **A rating (1-6) of your satisfaction with the information provided about Ben & Jerry's history.**

7. **A rating (1-6) of the difficulty in finding Ben & Jerry's contact information.**

8. **A rating (1-6) of the overall user-friendliness of the website.**

9. **Your first impression of the website.**

10. **At least three features/elements you liked, with details and examples.**

11. **At least three features/elements you disliked, with details and examples.**""". If you achieved your ultimate task, stop everything and use the done action in the next step to complete the task. If not, continue as usual.

About Us
From a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont, to far-off places with names we sometimes mispronounce, the journey that began in 1978 with 2 guys and the ice cream business they built is as legendary as the ice cream is euphoric.
[12]<a false;button>Through The Decades:/>
1978
Humble Beginnings
With a $5 correspondence course in ice cream-making from Penn State and a $12,000 investment ($4,000 of it borrowed), Ben and Jerry open their first ice cream scoop shop in a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont.
[13]<img />
1979
Next Step...
Ben and Jerry celebrate the shop's one-year anniversary – and the customers who made it possible – by holding the first-ever Free Cone Day: free scoops for all, all day long. The annual ice cream give-away continues today in scoop shops around the world.

About Us
========

From a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont, to far-off places with names we sometimes mispronounce, the journey that began in 1978 with 2 guys and the ice cream business they built is as legendary as the ice cream is euphoric.

With a $5 correspondence course in ice cream-making from Penn State and a $12,000 investment ($4,000 of it borrowed), Ben and Jerry open their first ice cream scoop shop in a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont.

Ben and Jerry celebrate the shop's one-year anniversary – and the customers who made it possible – by holding the first-ever Free Cone Day: free scoops for all, all day long. The annual ice cream give-away continues today in scoop shops around the world.

Ben and Jerry rent space in an old spool and bobbin mill on South Champlain Street in Burlington and begin packing their ice cream in pints. The reason? To distribute to grocery and Mom & Pop stores along the restaurant delivery routes Ben services out of the back of his old VW Squareback wagon.

As the news of Ben & Jerry's spreads, more & more people want a lick. So the first franchised scoop shop opens in Shelburne, Vermont.

The old gas station is demolished to create a parking lot. Just before the wrecking ball is swung, the new Ben & Jerry's on Cherry Street in Burlington is up & scooping.

Ben & Jerry's ice cream is used to build "the world's largest ice cream sundae" in St. Albans, Vermont; the sundae weighs 27,102 pounds.

Ben & Jerry's sets a precedent by discovering a little-known clause about stocks and brokering, then establish a Vermont-only public stock offering to raise money for a new manufacturing plant.

The Ben & Jerry's Foundation is established with a gift from Ben and Jerry & 7.5% of the company's annual pre-tax profits to fund community-oriented projects.

Ben & Jerry's launches the Cowmobile, a modified mobile home used to distribute free scoops in a unique, cross-country "marketing drive." On the return trip, the Cowmobile burns to the ground outside of Cleveland, Ohio (no one was hurt). Ben said it looked "like the world's largest Baked Alaska."

Ben & Jerry's introduces Cherry Garcia® ice cream. Named for Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia at the suggestion of two "DeadHeads" from Portland, Maine, Cherry Garcia® becomes the first ice cream named for a rock legend.

Ben and Jerry are named “U.S. Small Business Persons of the Year” by President Reagan in a White House Rose Garden ceremony. Jerry's one suit comes in handy and, luckily, Ben finds an Italian waiter's jacket to wear.



![Ben & Jerry holding their award plagues](/files/live/sites/systemsite/files/US%20and%20Global%20Assets/About%20Us/Timeline/timeline_0011_1988.jpg?imwidth=1200)

Ben & Jerry's comes out against Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH), based on concern about its adverse economic impact on family farming and public confidence in the wholesomeness of dairy products.

Eight million Ben & Jerry's pints carry a "Support Farm Aid" message as part of the grassroots efforts of Farm Aid, a non-profit organization whose mission is to keep family farmers on their land.

Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is released in pints after years of research and development. The flavour rockets to the top of the most-popular-in-pints list. Today it still reigns among our all-time flavour hits. (The first-ever batch of the flavour was created in Ben & Jerry’s Burlington scoop shop in 1984, the result of an anonymous note scribbled on the shop's suggestion board).

Ben & Jerry's joins in a cooperative campaign with the national non-profit, Children's Defense Fund; the campaign goal is to bring children's basic needs to the top of the national agenda. Over 70,000 postcards are sent to Congress concerning kids and other national issues.

Wavy Gravy leads the pack of new flavours. It's named after the famous 1960's Woodstock Festival personality who is today a one-man non-profit helping kids.

Ben & Jerry's introduces Sorbets made with pure spring water & the best fruits & flavourings. Doonesberry® Sorbet is named after the popular "Doonesbury®" comic strip character. It has since been sent to the Flavour Graveyard.

The great music & renowned concert tours of the Vermont-based musical group, Phish®, inspire Phish Food® ice cream.

Some folks thought our packages were hard to read (& the flavours hard to resist), so after 20 years we dressed up our pints with a fresh new look!

August 3, 2000: Ben & Jerry’s becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unilever. Through a unique acquisition agreement, an independent Board of Directors is created to provide leadership focused on preserving and expanding Ben & Jerry's social mission, brand integrity, and product quality. We call them the B.O.D. (Which means we really like them.)

It's an ice cream flavour...it's an environmental action website...it's One Sweet Whirled™ and it's all interconnected, as Ben & Jerry's partners with Dave Matthews Band® & SaveOurEnvironment.org in a campaign to help fight global warming.

Ben & Jerry's kicks off the year with a birthday bash at our factory in Waterbury, Vermont at the first-ever Winter Fest. Still crazy after 25 years.



![Woodie the cow with the thought of still crazy after 25 years ](/files/live/sites/systemsite/files/US%20and%20Global%20Assets/About%20Us/Timeline/timeline_0031_2003.jpg?imwidth=1200)

In an effort to drive voter turnout among young people in the US, Ben & Jerry's partners with Rock the Vote. RTV street teams leverage the long lines of customers on Free Cone Day to register over 11,000 voters – the biggest one-day grassroots registration in Rock the Vote's history.

To protest proposed oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we construct a 900-pound Baked Alaska with our Fossil Fuel ice cream, shoulder it onto the US Capital lawn and serve it up with the help of Greenpeace and the Alaska Wilderness League.



![A lady hold sign Drilling is Not the ANsWer next to a piece of baked Alaska ](/files/live/sites/systemsite/files/US%20and%20Global%20Assets/About%20Us/Timeline/timeline_0029_2005.jpg?imwidth=1200)

Ben & Jerry's continues to support fair trade efforts which started with Coffee and the launch of Coffee Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz in 1996 by adding Vanilla and Chocolate to the line-up. Fairtrade certification guarantees that the farmers who grow the vanilla, cocoa and coffee beans get a fair price for their harvest, enabling them to reinvest in their land and communities.

When the U.S. Food & Drug Administration declared that it believed meat and milk from cloned animals was safe to eat, we were beside ourselves, twice over! To show our disappointment with the FDA's decision – and to urge Americans to speak out against cloning – we sent a determined herd of cow-costumed folks to Washington, D.C. for a "Truth or Clone-sequences" demonstration.

We hold an international “Do the World a Flavor” contest encouraging people to share their ideas for a Fairtrade flavour. Top contestants visit the Dominican Republic, tour a cocoa co-op, and build a playground for children in the village of Yabon. The winning flavour, Almond Delight, is featured in scoop shops across the US as a Limited Batch in 2010.

Ben & Jerry's makes a significant commitment to source Fairtrade ingredients and to support the global Fairtrade movement. We’re in the process of converting our ingredients to Fairtrade globally where we feel we can have the greatest impact on improving the lives of farmers, strengthening their communities and protecting the environment.

When protestors in New York City and other places take to the streets under the Occupy Wall Street banner in the fall of 2011 to rally against increasing economic inequality in the United States, high unemployment, mortgage fraud, and too much corporate influence in American politics, Ben & Jerry’s Board of Directors issues a direct statement of solidarity, and we show up in Zucotti Park on several occasions to scoop ice cream for Occupiers.

Ben & Jerry’s gets creative with real Greek yogurt, introducing an epic selection of Greek Frozen Yogurt flavours that are uniquely creamy, boldly loaded with chunks and swirls, and really Greekin' good!

GMO? Thanks, but No.
-------------------------

![A sign saying no GMO](/files/live/sites/systemsite/files/US%20and%20Global%20Assets/About%20Us/Timeline/timeline_0036_2013.jpg?imwidth=1200)

As the campaign to label food products made with GMO ingredients moves across the states, including Vermont, Ben & Jerry's is proud to stand with the growing consumer movement for transparency and the right to know what’s in our food supply by supporting mandatory GMO labeling legislation. In 2013, we also commit to transitioning all of our ingredients to be fully sourced non-GMO.

Fans Make Non-Dairy Demands!
---------------------------------

![A table of almonds with Made with Almond Milk logo](/files/live/sites/systemsite/files/US%20and%20Global%20Assets/About%20Us/Timeline/timeline_0022_2014.jpg?imwidth=1200)

Our fans have spoken and want a Non-Dairy option, they even went as far as starting a [Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/tell-ben-jerry-s-you-want-non-dairy-ice-cream-options).

2015
Another Flavour for Fallon...The Tonight Dough!
----------------------------------------------------

![A Dish of The Tonight Dough along with a pint](/files/live/sites/systemsite/files/US%20and%20Global%20Assets/About%20Us/Timeline/timeline_0021_2015.jpg?imwidth=1200)

The concoction is caramel and chocolate ice creams with chocolate cookie swirls & gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough & peanut butter cookie dough. If the flavour becomes half as popular as the unflappable Fallon, who was dubbed “entertainer of the year” in the US, it may give Ben & Jerry’s other classic combinations a run for their money.

Our Non-Dairy flavour creations are made with almond milk, 100% Certified Vegan, and boldly loaded with chunks and swirls. You’ll get Ben & Jerry’s euphoria in every bite. These flavours deliver everything… but the cow. The first Non-Dairy flavours in our line up were: Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Chunky Monkey, Coffee Caramel Fudge and P.B. & Cookies.

IT'S BEN & JERRY'S, ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT

Pint Slices, inspired by the very best part of the pint, give fans a way to enjoy euphoric flavours, chunks and swirls in a round single serving that’s enrobed in a decadent chocolatey coating. It’s a to-go order of ice cream goodness that’s easy to take on the road, and hard to resist.

Alongside all those nutty chunks, this pint packs a powerful message under its lid. Together, we can build a more just and equitable tomrrow.

Ben & Jerry's flavor & action campaign supporting reforms that invest in people instead of prisons to deliver justice for all, instead of just for some.
