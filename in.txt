Q1: What was your first impression of the Ben and Jerry's website?
Open Questions Section
 

This section is designed for you to give detailed feedback about your user experience of the Ben and Jerry's website. 

Hint: Your feedback should only focus on the UK website and not on the product/company itself. 

 
How to Give Feedback about Software Usability 

The purpose of your feedback is to explain to the developer of the website, why specific features and elements of the website contributed to a positive or negative experience for you as a user. Each of your feedback points should focus on a different aspect of the website for instance: navigation, design, functionality and with specific examples e.g. scoop shop locator, flavour filtering tool etc. Keep in mind, that this gives you the opportunity to have a say in how the functionality/look of the site could be improved.
 

Checklist
When navigating the site, think about:

    How easily (quickly and with as few clicks as possible) did you find the information you wanted? 
    Did menus/pages/buttons/general content have clear titles? Or were you, at times, confused by the headings chosen?
    When you clicked on an item, did it direct you to the type of content you were expecting to find under that name?
    How consistently was the information presented? Did similar functions look and work similarly?
    How consistent was the (overall) design? 
    How do specific design elements e.g. fonts, images, colour schemes contribute to your overall impression? 

 
Common Mistakes

Insufficient or no explanation given to support your point e.g. "I liked the website, it was user-friendly/easy to navigate/intuitive." You need to give a specific reason to explain WHY you think the site is "user-friendly" [and so on] and/or provide an example of a feature/element which supports this point. 

Focusing only on your personal opinion (when it’s not part of the question) e.g. "I disliked the use of red, because I do not personally like the colour red." This kind of feedback is not constructive because if the developer were to change the colour of the site to, say, blue, to fit in with your personal preference, other users could equally complain because they like pink/green/purple etc. better.
What your feedback should look like

"The app showed my progress (in setting up an account) well – it told me which stage out of 10 I was currently completing and included a progress bar. I liked knowing how much I still had left to do. It gave me the option to save my progress at the end of every stage too, so I wasn’t worried about losing my progress."

"However, it was hard to read any text on the landing page because there was so much red in the background. There is not enough contrast between the font colour (bright red) and background colour (dark red), so key information is easily missed. Also, the lack of distinction between the colour of hyperlinks and normal text made it hard to find these links."
